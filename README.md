It just seemed way to hard to markup, css, bind, scope, render, update and then
change view in all conventional frameworks, so i decided to set as my goal a framework of less than  1200
lines that would let my four year old son, say to a computer--"tabs, included pages my favorites on xyz"
as easily as he can say to a pad,
"6 inch marvel figures" 
or to appletv "play suicide squad".... 
The over under is.... woops, all businesses and people who want the web to be a tool building and tool sharing 
and learning platform also get an easy way to make basic render tools. 

Ideal system:
just use canvas.  Render all the elements layout, tables, graphs, whatever... pixel by pixel... not by drawing them
that would be redundant, but by tracing them. 

64 bit maps to the color options per pixel 1-1, so use a bufferarray done. use some generators, 
extrapolate at least every other pixel, make everything easy. New tools can be made by folks 
just drawing what they think they want and then the browser and seo sends back one ofthe 1x10^googleplex number of
reference renders browser has rendered, cataloged, indexed, stored, rerendered, and analyzed to be a solid browser.

Yeah! awesome!.  Everyone wins.

REALITY: 
I am still learning, so i do things in steps.  I know the end, but still have to go through the stages, so I dont get lost.
Result: html css stays short term. 

Reality part two: I dont have the records of all the browswer renders, seo markups, etc.  I just dont.
Someone with a browser likely does. I know if I had a browswer i made and people used for twenty years, I would have 
recorded all the rendored, stored them, compiled, reduced and synthesized them, and then just spit best practice back. 
That may happen. I hope.  But I cant do it.  So ideal solution, meet window, you're headed out.

Practical CONCEPT Version 1: 
Use parser, database data, css reducer i made, data pattern finder, filters, json data, 
js database objects, and object eaters, to offer general patter for soup to nuts(dumb phrase) interface builder. 

Ideally, the practical concept would read a business, personal, or family database-dataset, classify it and then build 
the interface that most suits the needs of the user.  Here when I say needs I dont mean--buy this junk. 
What I mean is build this thing you need, or organize this part of your life this way, because you arent and it sucks for you.

In total, it might be a radically lame idea. 

That said, I just think it should be done.  The point of a community based on data 
and human concerns should be to helpful... like in a general, we should be nice... 
In a "hey the world is better
if we are all better" sort of way.


Licensing: You can use whatever I put up, but whaterver you make with it is public and others can have it too. 

You can sell it, and if people buy it, cool.  But if someone else uses what you added, and sells it, 
you dont have any rights too their sales. Likewise, whatever they built goes public too. its a pass left license.  
Only thing you cant do is sell the stuff 
shared publically without adding a "significant feature".  Significant feature means one distinguishable "widget" 
that offers additional functionality not otherwise offered.  

What this means is pretty specific:  If you add a color pallet dropdown, that can let people customize their tools in terms of color,
design, whatever, and one doesnt already exist that does the same junk.  Bravo... winner. You can sell that, in a package, offer support, etc.
It's still public.  so others can add on and and sell your work plus the new stuff, but you're good on sales.  What you cant do is like, 
change the color, try and gain intellectual property on two shades off of yellow, and hide it.  

This is more or less an MIT+gnu license.

I will formalize the licensing by October 6, 2017.  Until then all rights reserved.

WHAT I WOULD LOVE: Some one more experienced to help me shortcut to the canvas render, add input or interface 
physics only on pointer capture etc sooner rather than later.  I would love to skip the drudge work.  I hope some of you like this.


Sincerely,

jason


Here is a codepen demo of the first widget.  About half the buttons work.

https://codepen.io/jfrazz/live/gGmYEM

goals for the week, add layout for full screen, calendar, todos, dayscedule and schedulemaking interfaces.  All written just need to be "shrunk"
